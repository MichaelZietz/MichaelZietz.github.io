## Welcome

This ePortfolio integrates the knowledge and skills I gained and developed throughout the years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It represent my growth in the program and gained honor rolls from high-quality outcomes. The ePortfolio was designed and developed with a professional-quality written and a visual communication demonstrative of my capacities and abilities in a coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to an specific technical audience and context.

In 2022, I began my studies at SNHU, but my computer science journey has been an ongoing study for over eight years. I innitially acheived my associate degree at community college while working for an IT service provider as a bench and remote technician, but after years of hands one experience with users' software issues, I desired to create programs that made their lives easier. Spanning multiple computer science fields, I have worked and learned in the pursuit of building a well rounded skill-set. I joined SNHU's program to improve my programming and application development understanding as well as sneak a glimps at what a career in software development life cycle (SDLC) might look like. This effort was derrived from of my passion for working with computers and technology, creating functional and creative user experiences, and experience working in IT as a technician.

While in the SNHU's computer science program, I have learned and improved my abilities, skills, and knowledge as a Full-Stack developer. I've honed my attention to detail and security essential skills for my role as a software engineer and developer. By staying organized and methodical in my code development, breaking tasks into manageable chunks, and integrating testing into my workflow, I've refined these abilities. Testing is vital for ensuring that a program functions properly and is free from weaknesses and vulnerabilities, which becomes increasingly challenging as projects grow more complex. Embracing both a tester mindset and a security-focused approach are crucial skills that continuously evolve and improve.
